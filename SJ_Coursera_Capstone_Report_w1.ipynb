    "#### Introduction/Business Problem\n",
    "Restaurants have a hard time choosing where to build new locations.  It depends on a plethora of conditions, such as traffic patterns, proximity to other similar restaurants, and distance from neighborhoods.  However, in this project, I look how the amount of Hispanic population in a city affects the diversity of restaurants.  I am specifically researching whether or to what extent the Hispanic ethnicity of the population of a city dictates the amount of ‘mexican’ restaurants.  This data and research would be of great interest to restaurants of any type as a factor in determining new locations.  This project could also be extended to include different ethnicities and more types of restaurants.  "

    "#### Data\n",
    "I choose the Phoenix metropolitan area to analyze.  It has a variety of ethnicities among its cities, and therefore is bound to have some variation to be scrutinized.  I use population data and the ratio or percentage of Hispanics for each city in the Phoenix metropolitan area, gathered from the 2010 census.  I am discarding all population in unincorporated areas; only people in the cities of Phoenix are included.  There were several cities (about three to five out of thirty) that I did not have ethnicity data for, so I excluded those cities as well. <br> <br>\n",
    "In my project, I compile the population and demographic data into one dataframe.  Then I add the latitude and longitude for each location in my dataframe.  Next, I query Foursquare to find the amount of Mexican restaurants in each vicinity, both as a number amount and as a percentage of the total number of restaurants in the area.  Lastly, I train and test several models to find the most accurate in predicting the proportion of Mexican restaurants in a given city based on the proportion of Hispanic population.  This gives me the ability to give a decision, with reasonable certainty, as to whether another Mexican restaurant might be successful in a certain area.  Of course, other data would be needed to determine the exact location and whether there are already too many restaurants for the population.  However, this project would be a useful metric in aiding a restaurant chain in deciding on new locations."
